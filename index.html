	<bold>Why People Hate Slytherin</bold>
	
	<bold><h3>People hate Slytherin because they think all villains were in Slytherin. But thats not true. Gilderoy Lockhart was in Ravenclaw,Professor Q was in Ravenclaw, and Peter Pettigrew was in Gryffindor.
	So not all villains were slytherins.</bold></h3>

	Slytherins are treated very badly. For example, In the first book 1,Slytherins would have won the house cup, But Gryffindor was rewarded 150 points for saving the school. But I feel like Gryffindor shouldn't have 
	been rewarded because they broke like 50 school rules. Slytherin worked hard to win. Gryffindor just wants all the glory. Also, If a Slytherin broke a school rule, they would be punished, but if a Gryffindor broke 
	a school they would be rewarded.</bold></h3>

	<Why Slytherin Isn't Bad>
	
	<bold><h3>Slytherin isn't really a bad house because it is full of ambitious and cunning people. You should remember that not all villains were in Slytherin.
